# NObodiesToricDegens
This is the Macaulay2 code of computations done in section 4.2 of my masters thesis in mathematics at KULeuven. 

We compute trop Gr(3,6), and compute a new embedding of Gr(3,6) which changes the tropicalization. 
We compute the cones of this new tropicalization and see how they correspond to the cones in the original embedding, as well as applying the wall-crossing construction to the newly obtained prime cones in the new embedding.
The cone labeled rho in the thesis is labeled intermediate in this code.

For a detailed explanation of the theory behind these computations, please refer to section 4.2 of my masters thesis.
